  <p>Here is where you can find some of my game designs!!</p>

  <h2>Half Empty</h2>
  <p>Half Empty is a minimalist 2D platformer that <br>
     explores how feelings of self doubt affect the <br>
     creative process. The game is releasing on PC <br>
     in April 2017.</p>

     The game has challenging combat in the vein of Dark Souls.<br>
     The purpose of the game is for the player to collect a <br>
     series of diary entries so that they may piece together<br>
     the storyline. The game is releasing on PC in April 2017</p>
